// **2026-08-23 correction — the USB host power pins were all wrong**,
// found on hardware chasing "the host stack enumerates nothing" (#163).
// Checked against M5Stack's own `M5Unified` (`src/utility/Power_Class.cpp`,
// the `board_M5StackCoreS3` path), which is the authority here:
//
// ```cpp
// static constexpr const uint32_t _core_s3_bus_en = 0b00000010; // port0 bit1
// static constexpr const uint32_t _core_s3_usb_en = 0b00100000; // port0 bit5
// static constexpr const uint32_t port1_bitmask_boost = 0b10000000; // port1 bit7
// // setUsbOutput(true) -> p0 |= _core_s3_usb_en; p1 |= port1_bitmask_boost;
// // setExtOutput(true) -> p0 |= _core_s3_bus_en; p1 |= port1_bitmask_boost;
// ```
//
// So USB host VBUS needs **two** pins, and neither is the one this file
// used to name `BUS_OUT_EN`: port1 bit7 runs the 5 V boost converter,
// port0 bit5 gates that rail onto the USB connector. Port0 bit1 is the
// *external* 5 V output (M-Bus / Grove) and has nothing to do with USB —
// yet it was the only bit host mode ever asserted. Its output-register
// readback duly said HIGH, which is why this looked for a long time like
// a device-side or cable fault: no converter was running, so no device
// ever saw VBUS, so nothing pulled up D+, which the host stack cannot
// distinguish from an empty port.
//
//   P0_0 = required by M5GFX, purpose unnamed (OUTPUT — `CFG0`'s
//          0b0001_1000 makes it one, and M5GFX drives it high before
//          the touch controller will answer). **Not** the touch
//          interrupt, which this comment used to claim: M5GFX puts
//          TP_INT on GPIO 21.
//   P0_1 = BUS_OUT_EN  (external 5V out — M-Bus/Grove, NOT USB)
//   P0_5 = USB_OTG_EN  (gates the 5V boost onto the USB connector)
//   P0_2 = SPK_EN      (AW88298 speaker amp enable; Phase 3-Core).
//          This table said P0_7 until 2026-08-23. The bit M5Unified
//          actually toggles is 2: `_speaker_enabled_cb_cores3` does
//          `bitOn(aw9523, 0x02, 0b00000100)` on enable and `bitOff` on
//          the same bit on disable. Copying M5GFX's display init, which
//          raises bits 0 and 2 together, therefore switched the
//          amplifier on — and the IC-705 stopped enumerating.
//   P1_0 = TP_RST      (touch reset, active LOW)
//   P1_1 = LCD_RST     (ILI9342C reset, active LOW)
//   P1_7 = BOOST_EN    (the 5V boost converter itself)
//
// Earlier correction (2026-08-15, same cross-check against M5GFX):
// LCD_RST/TP_RST were swapped, and **LCD_BL is not an AW9523 pin at
// all** — the backlight runs off AXP2101's DLDO1 rail (register `0x90`
// bit `0x80` to enable, `0x99` for voltage), which `pmic.rs` writes
