//! What a slot-grid phase error costs the **board's** driver, measured
//! on the host.
//!
//! The CoreS3 receiver sets its slot grid once — NTP/RTC, or a cold
//! acquisition — and holds it (`m5stack-cores3-app`'s decode pipeline,
//! "lock and hold"). Where that grid lands is therefore a decision
//! taken once per session, and on 2026-09-16 three boots of one image
//! against one baked slot settled at `dec` 8, 6 and 5, flat for every
//! slot of each capture. Deciding what to *do* about that needs the
//! shape of `dec` against phase, and taking it on hardware costs a
//! flash and several minutes per point.
//!
//! `decode_block_multipass` has two bodies split on `fft-rustfft` —
//! three passes with subtraction between them under it, one pass with
//! none without — so a host build with `fft-extern,fixed-point` runs
//! the board's single-pass driver, and scores 7 of the 20-entry fixed
//! golden against the board's own `dec=7` on the same recording
//! (`ft8_embedded_driver_recall.rs` pins that).
//!
//! ## This is an approximation, and it has misled once
//!
//! Matching one number at one phase is not matching the path. Two
//! differences remain, and both matter for phase:
//!
//! - **Search width.** `decode_block` runs FT8's default ±2.5 s coarse
//!   search. The board's per-slot path runs `stage1_inc`'s
//!   `SYNC_LAG_S = 1.0`. A phase whose signals sit at DT +1.5 s decodes
//!   well here and not at all there. The `in1s` column (decodes at
//!   |dt| <= 1.0) is the correction, and it is the column to read.
//! - **Candidate flow.** `decode_block` has its own pass-1 limit and
//!   refine. The board goes `coarse_sync_with_lag` → early/late split
//!   → `refine_candidates_into` → `process_candidates_into_…`
//!   (`embedded-shared/src/dual_core.rs`). This file does not model
//!   that, and its `in1s` ceiling is 7 where the board has run at 8.
//!
//! On 2026-09-16 the first bullet was missed: scored on the ±2.5 s
//! count, "align the grid to the earliest decode" beat the median rule
//! 6.30 to 5.50, was implemented, and on `in1s` scores **1.00** against
//! **4.70**. It was reverted before it reached a board. Treat anything
//! this file says about *which phase is best* as provisional until
//! `ft8_embedded_pipeline_mirror.rs`, which follows the board's own
//! candidate flow, agrees.
//!
//! The SIM harness loops **one whole slot**, so a grid at phase `phi`
//! sees a window that wraps — the tail of one copy followed by the head
//! of the next. `rotate_left` reproduces that exactly, which matters:
//! signals straddling the seam are the ones a phase error costs.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test -p mfsk-core --release --no-default-features \
//!     --features alloc,ft8,fft-extern,fixed-point,internal-testing \
//!     --test ft8_embedded_grid_phase -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//! Drop `fixed-point` for the f32 twin. Diagnostic: it prints a table
//! and asserts nothing about the shape, because the shape is what is
//! being looked at.
//!
